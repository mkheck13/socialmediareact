**Reviewer:** Kassandra Spacek

**Comments:** Everything looks good. The hover/button effects are all there. The only issue I see is the top background pattern goes over to the side too much and makes the page side scroll.

**Update:** Fixed the overflow issue. Also noticed that some of the text was to small so I adjusted it to look more like the design.
